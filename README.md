# neuroavalanche - Estimating avalanche phenomena in EEG and MEG data

This code processes electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) time courses and estimates the timing and distribution of neuronal avalanches, together 
with the associated delays and transition probabilities. 

This approach is explained in the following journal publications:

- Shriki et al. (2013), "Neuronal Avalanches in the Resting MEG of the Human Brain", J Neurosci [link](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/16/7079.abstract)

- Sorrentino et al. (2021), "The structural connectome constrains fast brain dynamics", Elife [link](https://elifesciences.org/articles/67400);

## Requirements

The code requires MATLAB (tested on version `R2021b`) - it does not leverage any specific toolbox.
